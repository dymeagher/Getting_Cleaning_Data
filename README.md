#Getting_Cleaning_Data Course Project

##Overview

This is the final course project for the Coursera/John's Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data MOOC.  The dataset contains 3D motion sensor data from experiments done by Samsung in 2012.

##Project Summary taken from the assigment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 

* A tidy data set as described below, 
* A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
* A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
  * You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts.
